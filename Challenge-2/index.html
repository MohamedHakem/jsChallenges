      <p id="interesting-fact">The name of the breed comes from Pomerania, which is the region of Northern Europe where they originated.
They are also known affectionately as Poms or Pom Poms.
These small dogs typically weigh around 7 to 10 pounds, but they’re descended from big sled dogs.
<br>
Hard to believe, right?<br><br>
Pomeranians weren’t always so little. They used to weigh as much as 20 to 30 pounds before being bred down in size by Queen Victoria of England.<br>
Despite their small stature, they are famous for thinking they can take on big dogs with their little bark.
<br>
This makes socializing a Pomeranian with other dogs important in order to avoid aggressive behavior.
<br><br>
        <span>Martin Luther</span>, a leader of the Protestant Reformation, had a Pomeranian named Belferlein who he often mentioned in his writing.
<br><br>
<span>Mozart dedicated</span> an aria to Pimperl who was his beloved Pomeranian.v
<br><br>
<span>Michelangelo</span> had a Pomeranian by his side as he painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.
<br><br>

Pomeranians can make wonderful therapy dogs. They are also trained as hearing assistance dogs.
<br>
Despite their furry coat, they don’t require a lot of grooming other than regular brushing, which can help reduce shedding.

      <p id="summary">Pomeranians weigh about five pounds but they have the personalities of something a lot larger. They are curious dogs, alert and interested in everything that is going on around them.<br> Often, their favorite spot at home is perched on a windowsill where they can take in as much neighborhood action as they can, barking often to let you know that someone is walking by. They love to be the center of attention, and have been known to behave mischievously in order to garner the attention they crave. Poms are very well suited for active seniors who can devote all of their time and energy to their dog.
